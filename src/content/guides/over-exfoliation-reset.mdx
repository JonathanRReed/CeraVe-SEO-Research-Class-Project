## Step 1: Stop exfoliants immediately
Shelve acids, scrubs, retinoids, and cleansing brushes. Over-exfoliated skin loses lipids and struggles to retain moisture. Give the barrier a break so it can rebuild.

## Step 2: Switch to lukewarm water
Cleanse with lukewarm water and a gentle formula such as `CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser`. Pat skin dry; avoid rubbing or tugging.

## Step 3: Moisturize in layers
Apply a ceramide-rich cream while skin is still damp. Press product in to minimize friction. Seal with `CeraVe Healing Ointment` on compromised areas to trap hydration.

### Daytime routine
Use a mineral SPF labeled for sensitive skin. Skip actives, makeup wipes, and astringent toners. Mist water lightly before reapplying moisturizer if you feel tight mid-day.

### Night routine
Cleanse once, moisturize, and spot-treat with ointment. Avoid double cleansing until skin normalizes. Sleep on a clean pillowcase and use a humidifier if indoor air is dry.

### Reintroduction plan
Add one exfoliant back after two calm weeks. Patch test on the jawline and use it no more than once weekly at first. Follow with moisturizer immediately. Document skin response in a notes app or photo log.

**Bottom line:** simplify, hydrate, and reintroduce products slowly to prevent another barrier setback.
