faqs:
  - question: "Should I cleanse twice a day if my skin feels tight?"
    answer: "If your face feels tight after washing, try cleansing only at night and rinsing with lukewarm water in the morning. Add a hydrating cleanser back when skin feels balanced."
  - question: "How long should I test a new routine before changing it?"
    answer: "Give a barrier-friendly routine at least four consistent weeks. Track how skin looks two hours after each step instead of switching products too quickly."
  - question: "Can I add actives like retinol or exfoliants to this routine?"
    answer: "Yes, after your barrier is stable. Introduce one active at a time, use it 1–2 nights per week, and moisturize immediately after to buffer potential dryness."

## Step 1: Cleanse once or twice a day
Choose a gentle, non-stripping cleanser. If your face feels tight after washing, the cleanser is too harsh. Look for keywords such as **hydrating**, **cream**, or **fragrance free**. `CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser` is a reliable start because ceramides support the barrier and it leaves a comfortable slip. If you work in a dusty or sweaty environment, wash after work too. On slow mornings, splash with lukewarm water and save cleanser for night.

## Step 2: Moisturize while skin is slightly damp
Apply moisturizer within one to three minutes after cleansing. Use a non-comedogenic cream if you prefer cushion or a lotion if you want something lighter. Hyaluronic acid pulls water toward the skin. Ceramides and cholesterol seal it in. For very dry areas, spot treat with a thicker cream at night. When comparing creams and lotions, pay attention to comfort two hours later—that feedback matters more than texture on application.

## Step 3: Use sunscreen every morning
Dry, sensitive skin still needs daily SPF. Target SPF 30 or higher, fragrance free, and labeled for sensitive skin. If sunscreens sting, try a mineral option. Apply a nickel-sized amount to your face and neck, and reapply if you work outdoors. Sunscreen prevents flaking, dark spots, and long-term barrier damage. It also protects the progress you’ve made with moisturizer.

### Extra supports for a dry season
Turn water temperature down, keep showers short, and run a humidifier if indoor air feels dry. Skip physical scrubs when your face is flaky. Replace them with a hydrating cleanser, moisturizer, and a soft washcloth once a week.

### How to pick the right cleanser
If you are brand new and wondering how to start a skincare routine for men, keep the cleanser decision simple. If your skin feels tight or looks dull, choose a hydrating cream cleanser. If you feel oily by lunch, pair a gentle foaming cleanser at night with a hydrating lotion to offset dryness. Consistency across four weeks matters more than the exact texture.

### Why CeraVe works for dry, sensitive skin
CeraVe formulas focus on ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids that rebuild the skin barrier. That synergy helps when you want an uncomplicated system that still addresses dry, flaky areas. If you want the best drugstore skincare routine for men, a hydrating cleanser, a non-comedogenic moisturizer, and a daily SPF cover most needs.

**Bottom line:** start with three steps, protect the barrier, and stay consistent for a month before judging results.
