faqs:
  - question: "Can I exfoliate flaky skin to remove the patches faster?"
    answer: "Skip exfoliation until the barrier calms down. Replace scrubs and acids with hydrating steps and apply a balm to flaky areas."
  - question: "How do I know if weather is causing my flaky skin?"
    answer: "Track flare-ups with local humidity. When humidity drops below 40%, add a humidifier and moisturize twice daily."
  - question: "What if flakes keep returning after repair?"
    answer: "Look at cleanser frequency, water temperature, and actives. Dial back to the three-step routine for two weeks, then reintroduce products one at a time."

## Step 1: Pause actives and simplify
Move to a three-step routine: gentle cleanse, rich moisturizer, daytime SPF. Put exfoliants, scrubs, and retinoids on hold. Dry skin needs time without over-processing to rebuild its barrier.

## Step 2: Cleanse with lukewarm water only
Water that is too hot strips natural oils faster. Wash your face with lukewarm water for 20 seconds. Pat dry with a soft towel. Use `CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser` at night to remove sunscreen and pollution without friction.

## Step 3: Moisturize generously
Apply a barrier-focused moisturizer within one minute after cleansing. Press product into the skin rather than rubbing vigorously. Finish with `CeraVe Healing Ointment` on flaky spots to lock in hydration overnight.

### Morning adjustments
Choose a mineral SPF if chemical filters sting. Layer a hydrating serum under moisturizer if indoor air is dry. Keep the product list short so you can monitor reactions clearly.

### Night routine reset
Stick to cleanse and moisturize only. Add a humidifier near your bed. If skin feels tight overnight, reapply moisturizer or a thin layer of ointment.

### Track progress
Take weekly photos in the same lighting to measure improvement. Calmed redness, reduced flakes, and a comfortable feel two hours after moisturizing all signal that the barrier is on track.

**Bottom line:** consistency and gentle care reverse flaky skin faster than harsh fixes.
