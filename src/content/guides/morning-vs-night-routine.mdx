## Morning routine: protect
Start the morning with intent to protect the barrier. If skin feels comfortable, rinse with lukewarm water. Otherwise, use a pump of `CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser`. Pat dry and apply a hydrating lotion, pressing over damp skin. Finish with broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher, covering face, ears, and neck. This protects against UV and indoor blue light that can worsen dryness.

## Night routine: repair
Nighttime is the chance to undo stress from the day. Cleanse with an effective yet gentle formula, especially if you wear sunscreen or work in a dusty space. Follow with a richer moisturizer like `CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion`. If you use actives, apply them after cleansing while skin is dry, then seal with moisturizer to reduce irritation.

### Adjust based on skin feedback
Monitor how skin feels two hours after each routine. If you feel dry or tight, boost nighttime moisture with a thin layer of ointment. If you look oily mid-day, add a quick rinse or toner splash without stripping products. Small tweaks maintain comfort without restarting your routine entirely.

### Weekly routine check
Once a week, evaluate product usage. Are you over-cleansing after workouts? Is indoor heat causing tightness? Matching routines to your schedule keeps the barrier resilient.

**Bottom line:** morning routine protects; night routine repairs. Keep both simple, fragrance free, and focused on consistent hydration.
