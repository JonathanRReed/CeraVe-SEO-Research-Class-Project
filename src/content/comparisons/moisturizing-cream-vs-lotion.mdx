## Absorption and feel
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream has a thicker, more occlusive texture that stays on the skin longer, providing sustained hydration. CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion absorbs faster and feels lighter, making it suitable for daytime use. If you have very dry skin that needs overnight repair, the cream's petrolatum content helps seal in moisture. For quick absorption without residue, the lotion works better.

## Barrier support
Both use ceramides, but the cream includes petrolatum for better occlusion—essential when rebuilding a compromised barrier. The lotion focuses on humectants and emollients for balanced hydration. If your skin stings or flakes, the cream provides more immediate relief.

## Layering considerations
Cream works well under sunscreen but may need 5–10 minutes to absorb fully. Lotion layers easily and reduces pilling under makeup. Both are fragrance free and non-comedogenic, so they suit sensitive skin without clogging pores.

## Decision tree
- Wake up with tight, flaky skin → Cream for overnight repair
- Prefer quick absorption → Lotion for daily use
- Need strong occlusion → Cream
- Want lightweight feel → Lotion

**Bottom line:** match texture to your skin's needs—cream for repair, lotion for comfort.
