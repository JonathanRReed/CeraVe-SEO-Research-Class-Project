## Texture and comfort
Both cleansers aim to stay gentle, but their textures feel different in use. `CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser` has a cream-gel slip that leaves skin hydrated after rinsing. `Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser` is lotion-like and can be rinsed or wiped away; it may leave a film if you do not rinse fully. Test each on half your face for three nights and see which side stays calm without moisturizer.

## Barrier support ingredients
CeraVe adds ceramides, cholesterol, and hyaluronic acid to reinforce the barrier—helpful for very dry or over-exfoliated skin. Cetaphil focuses on a mild surfactant system and humectants. If you are rebuilding your barrier, the ceramide blend can speed up comfort.

## Foaming vs non-foaming options
A foaming cleanser is not automatically harmful. CeraVe’s cream-to-foam version uses amino acid-based surfactants that stay gentle. If you feel tight after any foam, switch back to hydrating cream textures and reduce wash frequency.

## Decision checklist
- Want a cushiony cleanse that rinses clean → CeraVe
- Want a lotion that feels barely there → Cetaphil
- Need to support a weakened barrier → CeraVe
- Want the best price per ounce → Cetaphil

**Bottom line:** pick the texture you will use daily and measure comfort 30 minutes after rinsing. Consistency matters more than small formula differences.
