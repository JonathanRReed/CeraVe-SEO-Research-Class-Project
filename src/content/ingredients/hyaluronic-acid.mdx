## What hyaluronic acid does
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a powerful humectant that attracts and retains moisture. It can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water, making it essential for dry skin hydration. HA occurs naturally in skin but decreases with age and environmental damage.

## Molecular sizes matter
- **High molecular weight HA**: Sits on skin surface for immediate plumping
- **Low molecular weight HA**: Penetrates deeper for sustained hydration
- **Hydrolyzed HA**: Smallest size for maximum absorption

Products with multiple HA sizes provide comprehensive hydration.

## Layering for dry skin
Apply HA serum after cleansing while skin is damp. Follow immediately with moisturizer to seal in hydration. Use with ceramides for optimal barrier repair. Avoid layering under heavy occlusives that might block absorption.

## Concentration tips
Start with 0.5â€“2% HA concentration. Higher percentages may cause irritation if skin is very dry. Patch test new products and monitor for increased dryness in low-humidity environments.
