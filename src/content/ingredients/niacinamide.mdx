## Why niacinamide matters
Niacinamide (vitamin B3) boosts ceramide production, making the barrier more resilient. It also improves skin texture and minimizes the appearance of pores, supporting a smoother, healthier look.

## Redness and sensitivity support
Regular niacinamide use calms redness triggered by weather shifts or over-exfoliation. Its anti-inflammatory properties help sensitive skin tolerate actives such as retinol with less irritation.

## Layering guidance
Apply niacinamide after cleansing while skin is still slightly damp. Follow with moisturizer to lock it in. It layers well with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and peptides.
