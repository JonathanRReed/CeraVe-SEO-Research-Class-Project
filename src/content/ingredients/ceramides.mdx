## What ceramides are
Ceramides are waxy lipids that form protective layers in the stratum corneum. They keep water inside the skin and block environmental irritants. When ceramide levels drop, the barrier weakens and moisture escapes, leading to dryness, redness, and flaking.

## Why barrier repair needs ceramides
Dry or over-exfoliated skin misses key lipids. Replenishing ceramides alongside cholesterol and fatty acids restores the 3:1:1 ratio the barrier prefers. That balanced blend helps cells align and prevents transepidermal water loss.

## Layering tips
Apply ceramide moisturizers after hydrating serums while skin is damp. Seal with an occlusive if air is dry. Ceramide creams work day and nightâ€”just adjust texture to your comfort level.
